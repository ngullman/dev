GitLab comes into two flavors, GitLab Community Edition (CE) our free and open

Closing policy for issues and merge requests

GitLab is a popular open source project and the capacity to deal with issues
and merge requests is limited. Out of respect for our volunteers, issues and
merge requests not in line with the guidelines listed in this document may be
closed without notice.

Please treat our volunteers with courtesy and respect, it will go a long way
towards getting your issue resolved.

Issues and merge requests should be in English and contain appropriate language
for audiences of all ages.

If a contributor is no longer actively working on a submitted merge request
we can decide that the merge request will be finished by one of our
Merge request coaches or close the merge request. We make this decision
based on how important the change is for our product vision. If a Merge request
coach is going to finish the merge request we assign the
coach will finish label.
